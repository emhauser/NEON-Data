In consultation with the Foliar Sampling TWG and other researchers, we decided that the focus should be on capturing the breadth of canopy species diversity across that site, and therefore the sampling strategy needed to shift.","From 2019 and onward, forest and shrubland sites sample according to a target taxa list, which contains all species present in the canopy (more diverse sites have longer lists and therefore more samples). The most common taxa are sampled with replication, with individuals spread out to capture site gradients, and rare species are sampled where possible. See the Protocol and Data Product User Guide for more details."

If field collection of an herbaceous clip strip from an assigned foliar sampling plot or subplot was not possible, samplingImpractical is populated with a value other than 'OK' (e.g., 'location flooded' or 'logistical') and only minimal metadata are recorded. Note that this is only relevant for herbaceous-dominated sites (grasslands). For sites dominated by woody individuals (forests/shrublands), this field is not used since there is no assigned list of plots/subplots."

While all NEON foliage samples are dried at 65C in the domain labs, they are sometimes then stored in paper bags or coin envelopes for weeks or even months before being ground, transferred to vials, and shipped. During this time they may accumulate moisture, especially in humid areas. Subsequent testing revealed that %C data are likely underestimated by 1.5-2.5% due to this lack of re-drying prior to analysis. As vegetation samples tend to have high %C (20% - 55%), this bias may have only minor impacts on many analyses, but is something for end users to keep in mind. For the other parameters (%N, C:N, d15N, d13C), testing suggests there were no detectable differences between re-dried samples and originals.","Affected data have been flagged with dataQF = dryingProtocolError in the `cfc_carbonNitrogen` table. For sample analysis dates starting in November 2020, all carbon-nitrogen samples are re-dried at 65C prior to analysis to drive out any residual moisture and improve data accuracy for % C. Samples collected in 2020 may have been analyzed before or after the change; check dataQF to determine which individual samples are affected."

Some traits (e.g., pigments, water content) are known to change over the course of the growing season, thus it is helpful for data users to know when samples were collected relative to the remote sensing data in order to decide how to apply foliar data for modeling or validation studies.","In order to communicate the temporal coupling of the two data streams, a new field called 'aopCollectDate' was added to the cfc_fieldData table. Is it not currently possible to add this information for foliar samples associated with field spectral measurements, but this is planned for the future."

Data have been reprocessed to remove the obfuscation of state-listed taxa. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites and sensitive species remain redacted at National Park sites."
